   ● Increased Visibility: Operators can showcase their tours to a wider audience, increasing bookings and revenue.

Alignment with Assessment Requirements
   ● Agile Methodology: The project can be developed iteratively, with feedback loops from both users and operators to refine features.
   ● Cultural Considerations: Incorporating local cultural elements into tour offerings (e.g., guided cultural experiences) will align with the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, emphasizing partnership and respect for Māori perspectives.
   ● Collaboration: The project will require collaboration among diverse team members, potentially including stakeholders from various cultural backgrounds to ensure inclusivity.

Potential Extensions
   ● Mobile Application: A companion mobile app for users to book and manage tours on the go.
